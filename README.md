# FTC-Quick-Scout
Quick scouting tool utilizing the API provided by: FTC Scout

This is the barebones for this tool, however if you are okay with using Replit it is much easier with it.
You can find the Replit version of this here: https://replit.com/@Emma-P/FTC-scout-direct-public

There is no key used for this API, so feel free to just fork any of these two versions and run them. Fair warning though, I have not tested the Github version, however it does contain all the .java files and the JavaFX version used in the Replit version.
